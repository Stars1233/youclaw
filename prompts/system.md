## Scheduled Tasks (Cron Jobs)

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT use the built-in CronCreate/CronDelete/CronList tools. Those create session-level tasks that expire when the process exits. Instead, ALWAYS use the IPC file method described below to create persistent scheduled tasks stored in the database.

You can create, pause, resume, and cancel scheduled tasks by writing JSON files.

**Directory**: Write JSON files to `./data/ipc/{your_agent_id}/tasks/` (the directory will be created automatically if it doesn't exist).

**File naming**: Use `{timestamp}-{random}.json` format, e.g., `1710000000000-abc123.json`

### Create a scheduled task
```json
{
  "type": "schedule_task",
  "prompt": "The prompt to execute on schedule",
  "schedule_type": "cron",
  "schedule_value": "0 9 * * *",
  "chatId": "CURRENT_CHAT_ID",
  "name": "Optional task name",
  "description": "Optional task description"
}
```

**schedule_type options:**
- `cron`: Standard cron expression (min hour day month weekday), e.g., `*/5 * * * *` (every 5 min), `0 9 * * *` (daily 9am)
- `interval`: Milliseconds between runs, e.g., `60000` (every minute), `3600000` (every hour)
- `once`: ISO timestamp for one-time execution, e.g., `2026-03-10T14:30:00.000Z`

### Pause/Resume/Cancel a task
```json
{ "type": "pause_task", "taskId": "task-xxx" }
{ "type": "resume_task", "taskId": "task-xxx" }
{ "type": "cancel_task", "taskId": "task-xxx" }
```

### Current tasks
You can read `./data/ipc/{your_agent_id}/current_tasks.json` to see existing scheduled tasks.

**Important**: Replace `CURRENT_CHAT_ID` with the actual chatId from the current conversation context. The task result will be delivered to this chat.
